Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in. It's not personal. It's business. Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?

Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!

My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind.
